# Device validation

These observations came from exploratory tests supplied by the product owner. The app itself has not yet performed hardware control.

## Proven

- LG 55UK6700YVD webOS TV: LAN pairing, input list query, and direct HDMI switching succeeded with a Windows CLI. Switching from PC to HDMI 3 / Xiaomi was observed.
- Xiaomi TV Box S (3rd Gen): LAN reachability and Android key input were proven using exploratory ADB over Wireless Debugging. This does not validate the production remote protocol.
- yes+: `KEYCODE_1` switched to channel 1 during playback.
- yes+: `KEYCODE_LAST_CHANNEL` did not work. Long `DPAD_CENTER` opened quick actions with “Last Channel” selected by default; a following short `DPAD_CENTER` switched to the previous channel.
- Samsung HW-M360: Samsung Audio Remote on an Android phone controlled Bluetooth Volume Up, Volume Down, and Mute while the soundbar stayed on optical `D.IN`.

## Not yet proven

- A production Google TV remote-protocol implementation without ADB.
- Xiaomi power and wake behavior through that protocol.
- LG power-on and power-off behavior in this app's own implementation.
- Samsung Bluetooth control protocol details and how to implement them in this app.
- Samsung power control.
- Automatic foregrounding or launching of yes+.

## Known TV input map

| Input | Device |
|---|---|
| HDMI_1 | PS5 |
| HDMI_2 | Mac mini |
| HDMI_3 | Xiaomi |
| HDMI_4 | PC |

The Samsung soundbar normally remains on `D.IN`. No production adapter in this repository uses ADB.
